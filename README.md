## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:

### `node/`

A working example of client- and server-side JavaScript (Node.js) programs that communicate over gRPC.

See the README in [node/](node/).

### `java/`

A working example of client- and server-side Java programs that communicate over gRPC.

See the README in [java/](java/).

### `go/`

A working example of client- and server-side Go programs that communicate over gRPC.

See the README in [go/](go/).

  * Unfortunately, the Node.js/JavaScript implementation does not include instructions on using the plugin mechanism of
    `protoc` to generate gRPC JavaScript code from `*.proto` files. By contrast, the GoLang implementation does have
    instructions so I used the GoLang instructions as a working example to figure out how to do the JavaScript one.
